# Credit Risk Prediction

## Overview


The objective of this project is to utilize machine learning models to forecast credit risk. The aim is to differentiate between "healthy loans" and "high-risk loans" by leveraging a logistic regression model trained on financial data. The dataset comprises diverse financial indicators including loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt-to-income ratio.
